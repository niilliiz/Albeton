# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I used [firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to be able to authenticate and may be needed to turn on vpn in order to use it properly. This is shallow copy of [albeton](https://www.ableton.com) only to practice React fundamentals.and also Redux library has been used to manage the states. -> this is [myableton](https://myableton.netlify.app)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
